# Project push_swap

# Goal
push_swap is a C project that implements a sorting algorithm using stacks. The goal is to sort a list of integers with the minimum number of operations, demonstrating efficient sorting techniques and algorithm optimization.

# Features
Sorting: Efficiently sort a list of integers using stack-based operations.
Operations: Utilize stack operations such as sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rb, rra, rrb, rr, and rrr.
Algorithm optimization: Find the optimal sequence of operations to sort the stack.
